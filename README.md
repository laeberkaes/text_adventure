# Textbased adventure game
Here you can find my first try of an text based adventure game ([game.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laeberkaes/text_adventure/master/beta/game.py)).
The other files are for trying some classes / importing stuff and will be implemented in the game in the future.

Was previously [here](https://github.com/laeberkaes/progprojects/tree/master/Python/adventure).

And will be in future at my own [Gitea instance](https://uraltemorla.xyz:3000/laeberkaes/text_adventure).
